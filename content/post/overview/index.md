## Background of the study
During the 2022 Philippine National Elections, the tensions between supporters of presidential candidates Leni Robredo and Bongbong Marcos peaked since this was the latter's defeat in the 2016 Vice presidency against the former. This was sustained throughout the term of Vice Presidente Leni Robredo because it was only on February 16, 2021 that the Presidential Electoral Tribunal (PET) unanimously dismissed the electoral protest of Bongbong Marcos.The conflict did not die down after Leni took oath as the 14th Vice President of the Republic of the Philippines because even during the partial and unofficial canvassing of votes, Marcos and his camp was already insinuating that Robredo and the Liberal party rigged or cheated. This was amplified by the previous administration's harassment of Robredo through official means and through social media trolls. It become ingrained in the minds of Marcos and Duterte supporters that Leni really cheated during the previous election.

Aside from protecting the honor of former VP Leni Robredo, combatting this kind of misinformation is crucial for the Filipino people because any politician can manipulate the masses into thinking that they were cheated on during the elections. This is dangerous because with the right material conditions, this can undermine the remaining specks of democracy in the archipelago.

As computer scientists, we have chosen the path of using data science in analyzing the trend in tweets accusing Leni of cheating during the 2016 General Elections, as our initial step in fighting misinformation.

Presented below is the formal definition of our problem:
## Problem Formulations

**Topic:** Leni cheated during the 2016 General Election

**Research Question:** Which time period triggered the reemergence of tweets accusing Leni of cheating during the 2016 General Election?

**Hypothesis:** The frequency of tweets accusing Leni of cheating in the 2016 General Election spiked after Leni’s announcement of presidential candidacy (October 7, 2021) up to Marcos Jr.’s first SONA (July 25, 2022).

**Null Hypothesis:** Leni’s announcement of presidential candidacy up to Marcos Jr.’s first SONA has no correlation with the spike in the frequency of tweets accusing Leni of cheating in the 2016 General Election.

**Action Plan:** Determine the posting date of tweets accusing Leni of cheating during the 2016 General Election and analyze the frequency of tweets using a line chart.

## Course of Action
Because we were able to define our problem clearly, we were able to describe, preprocess, and explore our data in the [Data section](/g31-leni-cheated-2016/post/data). This allowed us to apply the correct data modeling technique in our [Data modeling section](/g31-leni-cheated-2016/post/methods/). Afterwards, we were able to obtain results that yielded important insights about our problem in the [Results and Conclusion section](/g31-leni-cheated-2016/post/results/).
